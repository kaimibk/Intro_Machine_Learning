## Final Project

**Title:** SVM Binary Classification on Embryo Growth Curves

**Collaborators:**
  - Tommy Lam
  - Professor Susanna Still

**Project Description:**
We sought to perform binary classification on various embryos into (1) euploid and (2) aneuploid using various measurements and patient information. For this analysis we employed a soft margin Support Vector Machine (SVM-C). In the end, we found a combination of features which yielded a score of 62Â±4 %.
